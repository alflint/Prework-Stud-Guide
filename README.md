# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- I created a web-based repository for all of my class notes for the U of U coding Boot Camp.
- This website will allow me easy access to items covered in class and will act as a guide for the entirety of the class.
- By creating this website, it allows me to have a central location for class information that I can have readily available, instead of having to re-read modules to search for specific items.
- I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I have been provided material to further my fundamental knowledge before starting class.
