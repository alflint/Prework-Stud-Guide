        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup language.</li>
          <li>HTML is one of the three cornerstone languages used in web development and is used to create the structure of a webpage.</li>
          <li>An element is a type of content on a webpage. Elements include: text elements, image elements, header elements, list elements.</li>
          <li>Common types of elements used to divide and describe a page include: meta-related elements, content division elements and semantic elements.</li>
          <li>HTML elements work together to build the structure of a webpage and provide a framework that makes it easy for a user t navigate the webpage.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>DOCTYPE is not case-sensitive because it is a declaration. Declarations are not case-sensitive; HTML elements are case-sensitive.</li>
          <li>An HTML attribute defines additional information about an element and are always defined at the beginning of an element, never the closing element.</li>
          <li>Metadata is data about our webpage that the browser uses to effectively serve our webpage to users.
          <li>Metadata is not typically seen by users but it contains important information about accessibility, search engines, and performance.</li>
          <li>The title element defines the title for the webpage, is required, and is extremely important for search engine optimization (SEO).</li>
          <li>Search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of improving the ranking of a website in search engines such as Google or Bing. Better SEO results in your website results in your website more frequently showing up in searches.</li>
          <li>The style element defines the CSS styles associated with a website</li>
          <li>The base element defines the base URL for a webpage</li>
          <li>The link element connects an external resource to the HTML document</li>
          <li>The meta element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author and viewpoint.</li>
          <li>The script element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document.</li>
          <li>To create a new branch: git status, git checkout main, git checkout -b feature/add-css.</li>
          </li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li>
          <li>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a program used by developers to define how webpage content is presented to users.</li>
          <li>CSS defines colors, aesthetic, visual layout and organization</li>
          <li>We use CSS to define style rules for specific elements of an HTML page and format them using a wide range of style options.</li>
          <li>CSS is a language that defines the design and layout of webpages.</li>
          <li>CSS allows us to style page elements how we want, including layout, color and style.</li>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS:inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS Style Sheet.</li>
          <li>Inline CSS - inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only. It is typically used when a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file.</li>
          <li>Inline is useful for quick and permanent changes but are less flexible than external and internal style sheets because each inline style must be edited individually whenever you make a design change.</li>
          <li>Internal Style Sheet - contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file and allows for the possibility to embed an entire stylesheet directly in the HTML file.</li>
          <li>Internal Style Sheet rules only apply to that page. You can configure CSS classes and IDs, which are used to identify elements, to style multiple elements in the page code.</li>
          <li>A single change to the CSS rule will apply to all tagged page elements using internal.</li>
          <li>External CSS Style Sheet - most common way to style a webpage and is preferred because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.</li>
          <li>Separate of concerns - refers to separating code into different files based on use. Each section of code should have its own responsibility.</li>
          <li>A selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply.</li>
          <li>Declarations - contain two components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.</li>
          <li>The margin property indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>The padding property adds space around the content inside of an element and is not the same thing as the margin property.</li>
          <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any elemen we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector. Then the class attribute can be assigned to the element in the HTML, enabling us to freely choose which elements will be assigned the CSS rule.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Git status: checks what branch we are currently on.</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch name: creates a new branch and switches to it.</li>
          <li>GitHub is a website for developers to store and manage their code via version control.</li>
          <li>GitHub is a cloud based hosting service that allows us to store our code, manage changes to our code and keep track of those changes.</li>
          <li>GitHub provides a platform to easily collaborate with other developers</li>
          <li>GitHub is similar to a social media platform where developers can share work.</li>
          <li>GitHub allows you to showcase your work to future potential employers</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript (JS) is a high-level dynamic programming language that allows users to interact with websites. Using JS, you can power your websites with effects, interactivity, and data communication.</li>
          <li>JavaScript is the tool that takes a static HTML/CSS webpage and makes it interactive.</li>
          <li>JavaScript is a programming language that allows us to implement more complex features on web pages</li>
          <li>JavaScript allows you to control multimedia, animate images, and dynamically control content.</li>
          <li>Variable - a named container that allows us to store data in our code. We use the var keyword to declare a variable.</li>
          <li>All strings are surrounded by quotation marks.</li>
          <li>The console.log method - used to output the value of topics to the web console.</li>
          <li>Open Chrome DevTools by right clicking and selecting "Inspect" or press command+option+I.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>In JS, code runs from the first statement at the top of the page, down to the last statement at the bottom of the page.</li>
          <li>Conditional Statements and loops - controls the order in which code is executed, or if it is even executed at all.</li>
          <li>An if statement is a way of introducing decision-making into our code. The code will only execute if the statement meets a condition or is true.</li>
          <li>if a condition isi truthy, the computer will do whatever the action is that we ask between the curly brackets. It not, it will ignore it.</li>
          <li>Array - a single variable that is used to hold a group of data.</li>
          <li>Index - the location of the data item in the array.</li>
          <li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
          <li>The conditional if statement is used to interrupt the control flow by executing a block of code a specific number of times.</li>
          <li>The first statement determines the starting point for the loop.</li>
          <li>The second statement is the condition.</li>
          <li>The final statement allows the array to iterate over each time.</li>
          <li>Commenting out code makes it inactive without deleting it using /* before and */ after the block of code.</li>
          <li>Function - a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task.</li>
          <li>Two requirements for a Javascript function: 1. Define the function and 2. Call the function.</li>
          <li>When we declare a function in our JavaScript code, we are creating a reusable block of code that performs a specific task. However, declaring a function does not mean that the code with automatically execute, we need to call the function.</li>
